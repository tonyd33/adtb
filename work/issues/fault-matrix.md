# Fault matrix

## Report

Sweeps sit at pager level. No `Database` workload runs under faults, and `Database::open` prefers io_uring, whose faults are absent. About 44 fixes and open bugs share two causes: a multi-step change not atomic under failure, and damage or failure giving a panic, hang or flattened error.

Build on the failing-and-crashing harness of backup round 4. For every workload (statement, commit, vacuum, reindex, scrub, verify, open, migration): fail each op, crash at each op, apply each rot kind to each page, on sim and on real backends through `Database`. Assert no panic and no hang, correct marks, acknowledged writes kept, reopen succeeds.

Then replace the fatal I/O panic classified by text (`panic_text`, storage/driver.rs, write/reindex.rs) with a typed payload, and give `Internal` and `Corrupt` a typed cause.

Close by reading the matrix: real-backend-faults-engine, heap-read-foreign-page-panics, space-append-spin, truncated-to-nothing, verify-sweeps-no-progress, catalog-open-error-nesting, deployment-refusal-sentinel, and parts of scrub-follow-ups and lost-bitmap-follow-ups.

From test-audit-a: no sweep reaches a commit refused after a quarantine mark, 0 refusals across 8 seeds under deep with 20 yields before commit. `a_commit_waits_for_a_mark_being_set_and_is_refused` covers one deterministic case. The matrix must reach this case, with a floor.
