# Feature: Comparative benchmarks

## Report

The plan mentions SQLite benchmarks at embedded beta, but no concrete track
defines readiness, comparable workloads, reproducible results or optimization
rounds. Existing simulator timings and subsystem performance tickets do not
establish comparative performance through normal application APIs.

The user requested cross-database benchmarks and repeated optimization rounds
on the roadmap, leaving timing to the lead. This is planned work, not a claim
that measurements exist or that adtb is faster.

## 2026-10-28: scheduling and acceptance

The lead schedules an initial embedded comparison after the current authority,
permission and checked-binding correctness work is verified and the campaign
concurrency/reopen workload is reliable. Run before broader server expansion;
do not wait for all operations features or deferred version translation. This
does not displace an active engine correctness repair. Reevaluate readiness at
each correctness milestone checkpoint. The scheduling gate is a verified slice,
not completion of every item on the broad milestone/roles tickets, so those
tickets are not artificial whole-feature dependencies here.

SQLite is the first embedded baseline under project/workload/embedded-oltp.
Research additional peers, maintained versions and available benchmark tools
at kickoff, following the KB workflow. Do not choose a new harness or dependency
without comparing existing tools and native interfaces. Dispatch implementation
to fresh agents in isolated jj workspaces with bounded briefs and landing order.

Acceptance for the first comparison:

- Versioned deterministic workloads and data generators; repeatable commands
  using actual application APIs and real runtime/storage. Document revisions,
  peer versions, build flags, hardware, filesystem, memory budgets, cache state,
  warmup and repeated-run procedure. Preserve raw measurements and variation.
- Ordinary OLTP controls plus campaign/ADT workloads covering constructor
  selection, indexed relationships, joins, atomic writes/retags and enforced
  invariants. Cover dataset sizes and concurrency levels. Measure open/reopen,
  loading/preparation and evolution separately from steady-state operations.
- Verify equivalent logical outcomes, isolation, acknowledged-write durability
  and constraint enforcement on every peer before timing. Include necessary
  schema encodings, triggers or transactional checks in the measured path.
  Document refused/unsupported cases and any remaining mismatch rather than
  silently weakening guarantees or treating omitted work as a speedup.
- Report completed logical transaction throughput, p50/p95/p99 latency, retry
  and abort rates, CPU, memory, I/O and storage footprint. Application latency
  includes queueing and retries. Distinguish throughput under offered load from
  successful work and retained state. Publish losses as well as strengths.
- Freeze the baseline before tuning. Profile measured hotspots, dispatch a
  bounded principled fix to the owner, run correctness checks and compare the
  same workloads before/after. Repeat rounds based on measured impact; reject
  noise, weakened semantics and unacceptable regressions. A correctness failure
  stops tuning and invalidates affected results until repaired and rerun.

Extend to client/server peers after the first authenticated server path has
verified binding, bounded admission/result lifetime and cancellation. Keep
embedded and client/server comparisons separate and expose protocol overhead.
Peer selection happens at that phase; no server readiness is claimed now.

Preserve a reproducible report with workload-specific conclusions and remaining
bottlenecks. Rerun relevant comparisons after major planner/executor/storage
changes and before embedded beta/server releases. Existing engine-open,
planner/executor and heap performance tickets are candidate fixes to prioritize
from profiles, not a mandatory prerequisite list or assumed causes of poor results.
No benchmark, optimization or code change was performed for this roadmap entry.
